# Attendance Management with VBScript

This visual basic script invokes a restricted Internet Explorer instance prompting for a QR code to be entered. It assumes that (1) the QR code resolves to a valid HTTP URL containing an employee-specific Google Sheet which will be used to clock in/out as well as estimate net pay and (2) the service account timeclock@nychineseschool.org is signed in on Google Chrome. Upon reading the QR code, a Chrome instance launched in kiosk mode is invoked and will navigate to the inputted URL. Once loaded, the end user is presented with a Sheet containing their name and large (Apps Script enhanced) "Clock In" and "Clock Out" buttons. After 30 seconds, the Chrome process is terminated; the IE instance is uninterrupted unless the cscript process is forcefully terminated via task manager or exit keyword "nycs" is entered.
